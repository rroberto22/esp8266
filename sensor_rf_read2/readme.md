Library Inclusion: The code includes the RCSwitch library to be able to use its functions and features.

Declaration and Object Initialization: An object of the RCSwitch class called mySwitch is declared and initialized.

Constant pinD2: A constant pinD2 is defined with a value of 4. This indicates that the RF receiver is connected to digital pin 4 of the Arduino.

setup() Function: In the setup function, the following tasks are performed:

  Serial communication is started with a baud rate of 115200 so that data can be displayed on the serial monitor.
  The RF receiver is enabled using the mySwitch object on pin pinD2.
  loop() Function: In the loop function, the following code is executed repeatedly:

It checks if there are received data available using mySwitch.available().
If data is available, the following actions are taken:
  The decimal value of the received code is printed using mySwitch.getReceivedValue().
  The length of the received code in bits is printed using mySwitch.getReceivedBitlength().
  The duration of the pulse of the received code in microseconds is printed using mySwitch.getReceivedDelay().
  The protocol used for communication is printed using mySwitch.getReceivedProtocol().

Then, mySwitch.resetAvailable() is called to mark that the available data has been processed, and the receiver is ready to receive new data.
